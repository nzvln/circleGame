# circleGame
In the center of the screen, a circle rotates to the right. "+" and "-" buttons at the bottom change the circle's size to fit between obstacles. Obstacles are horizontal lines appearing above and below the circle, moving right to left. Collisions trigger vibration. After 5 collisions, an alert prompts for a screen restart.
